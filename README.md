# YouTube Remote

This extension creates a Websocket server and is to be used in conjunction with a Chrome Extension that is also provided. When both extensions are installed and running, VScode and Chrome will communicate via Websockets. You can use the command "Play/Pause YouTube or Udemy Video in Chrome" to toggle the currently-active YouTube or Udemy video. If you have more than one, the command will be issued to all of them. My recommendation is to use only one video at a time.

You can assign a keyboard shortcut to that command. I prefer something quick like Command + K L. This is known as a [https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings](Chord).
